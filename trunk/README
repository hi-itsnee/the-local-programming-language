local compiler

To run,

  python local.py PROGRAME

where PROGNAME is the name of the program you wish to compile

If you want the output saved to a file that you can then execute with Python,
run

  python local.py PROGNAME > TARGNAME

where TARGNAME is the name of the target Python file

For example,

  python local.py hello.local > hello.py

You can then run hello.py with Python.

  python hello.py

### Developer Instructions
--------------------------
To compile a working copy of our code for testing, do the following steps:
1. Create your new file, e.g. assign_statement.py
2. Check for compilation errors by running:
    python assign_statement.py
3. Create a local program to test your statement, e.g. /local/checkassign.local
4. Test the program with the following:
    python local.py /local/checkassign.local > /local/checkassign.py
5. Run the test output:
    python /local/checkassign.py
